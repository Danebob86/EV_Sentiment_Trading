# Electric Vehicle Sentiment Trading

This Project was done using Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques. Python libraries like Pandas (for Data Cleaning/Manipulation), Tweepy (for Tweets Mining), NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), TextBlob (for Sentiment Analysis), MatPlotlib & WordCloud (for Data Exploration), Emot (for Emojis identification), Plotly (for some Data Visualisation) were used for this project.

To reach the ultimate goal, there was a need to clean up the individual tweets. To make this easy, we created a function "preProcessTweets" in my Python program which we further applied to the "Tweets" to produce the desired results. This user-defined function was used to remove punctuations, links, emojis, and stop words from the tweets in a single run. Additionally, we used a concept known as "Tokenization" in NLP. It is a method of splitting a sentence into smaller units called "tokens" to remove unnecessary elements. Another technique worthy of mention is "Lemmatization". This is a process of returning words to their "base" form.
